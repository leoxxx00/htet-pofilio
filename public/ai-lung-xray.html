            <p class="description">Summary:

COVID:

9 True Positives
5 False Negatives (predicted as Normal)
3 False Negatives (predicted as Pneumonia)
Normal:

3 False Positives (predicted as COVID)
15 True Positives
0 False Negatives (predicted as Pneumonia)
Pneumonia:

0 False Positives (predicted as COVID)
0 False Positives (predicted as Normal)
16 True Positives
The diagonal elements represent the correct predictions, and the off-diagonal elements represent the misclassifications. From this matrix, we can infer:

The model performs well in classifying Pneumonia, with no misclassifications (100% accuracy for Pneumonia).
The model has some difficulty distinguishing between COVID and Normal, with several misclassifications between these two classes.
